# rkt prepare

rkt can prepare images to run in a pod.
This means it will fetch (if necessary) the images, extract them in its internal tree store, and allocate a pod UUID.
If overlay fs is not supported or disabled, it will also copy the tree in the pod rootfs.

In this way, the pod is ready to be launched immediately by the [run-prepared](run-prepared.md) command.

Running `rkt prepare` + `rkt run-prepared` is semantically equivalent to running [rkt run](run.md).
Therefore, the supported arguments are mostly the same as in `run` except runtime arguments like `--interactive` or `--mds-register`.

## Example

```
# rkt prepare coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.10
rkt prepare coreos.com/etcd:v2.0.10
rkt: using image from local store for image name coreos.com/rkt/stage1-coreos:0.14.0
